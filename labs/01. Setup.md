# 01.0 - Initial Setup

To get started, first create a new Spring Boot project using the [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/#!type=gradle-project&language=java&platformVersion=3.0.7&packaging=jar&jvmVersion=17&groupId=com.yugabyte.labs&artifactId=ysql-testcontainers&name=YSQL%20Testcontainers&description=Labs%20for%20using%20Testcontainers%20with%20Spring%20Boot&packageName=com.yugabyte.labs.ysql.tc&dependencies=web,actuator,data-jpa,testcontainers,flyway,postgresql)
(if you use the provided URL it will preselect the required dependencies).

Unzip and import this project into your favorite IDE.

These labs assume the use of IntelliJ from Jetbrains but any modern IDE will suffice.

# 01.1 - Run the Project

Once imported you should try to run the project.

If the IDE does not autodetect the main class, you can also run the application via the command line:

```shell
$ ./gradlew bootRun
```

It will most likely fail like this:

```txt
***************************
APPLICATION FAILED TO START
***************************

Description:

Failed to configure a DataSource: 'url' attribute is not specified and no embedded datasource could be configured.

Reason: Failed to determine a suitable driver class


Action:

Consider the following:
	If you want an embedded database (H2, HSQL or Derby), please put it on the classpath.
	If you have database settings to be loaded from a particular profile you may need to activate it (no profiles are currently active).
```

Even though we have a Postgres driver available, Spring cannot start up without a Datasource configured.

One traditional option is to include an "embedded" database like H2 or Derby and, if we included the correct JAR, the
Spring Boot application would launch.

However, this is a not desirable as we want to maintain [dev-prod parity](https://12factor.net/dev-prod-parity) as much
as possible and not be surprised at differences between databases.

# 01.2 - Run the Database

To achieve this, we either need to [download and install a distribution of YugabyteDB](https://download.yugabyte.com/)
directly or run an instance via Docker:

```shell
$ docker pull yugabytedb/yugabyte:2.16.3.0-b43
$ docker run -d --name yugabyte  -p7000:7000 -p9000:9000 -p5433:5433 -p9042:9042 yugabytedb/yugabyte:2.16.3.0-b43 bin/yugabyted start --daemon=false --ui=false
```

This will run a single node YugabyteDB instance and expose the significant ports for both [YSQL](https://docs.yugabyte.com/stable/api/ysql/)
and [YCQL](https://docs.yugabyte.com/stable/api/ycql/) workloads.

If the Docker approach works, you should have a process running:

```
$ docker ps

CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                              COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 NAMES
1cba0e174ab4   yugabytedb/yugabyte:2.16.3.0-b43   "/sbin/tini -- bin/yâ€¦"   3 seconds ago   Up 2 seconds   0.0.0.0:5433->5433/tcp, :::5433->5433/tcp, 6379/tcp, 7100/tcp, 0.0.0.0:7000->7000/tcp, :::7000->7000/tcp, 0.0.0.0:9000->9000/tcp, :::9000->9000/tcp, 7200/tcp, 9100/tcp, 10100/tcp, 11000/tcp, 0.0.0.0:9042->9042/tcp, :::9042->9042/tcp, 12000/tcp   yugabyte
```

# 01.3 - Configure the Database

Then all is needed is to define the Datasource URL and authentication info.

Rename the `src/main/resources/application.properties` to `src/main/resources/application.yml` and add:

```yaml
spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5433/yugabyte
    username: yugabyte
```

Note that YugabyteDB YSQL is compatible with PostgreSQL but uses the port `5433` (instead of `5432`).

Now run the application again - the process should start without errors.

# 01.04 - Additional Details

If you peruse the logs, you may notice a few WARN messages:

```text
2023-05-09T11:50:01.049-04:00  WARN 359023 --- [           main] o.f.core.internal.command.DbValidate     : No migrations found. Are your locations set up correctly?
```

We added [Flyway](https://flywaydb.org/) to the `build.gradle` at the outset and this is just highlighting the fact that
we haven't configured an actual migration (we'll address that in the labs in section 3).

There is an additional WARN from Spring itself:

```text
2023-05-09T11:50:01.605-04:00  WARN 359023 --- [           main] JpaBaseConfiguration$JpaWebConfiguration : spring.jpa.open-in-view is enabled by default. Therefore, database queries may be performed during view rendering. Explicitly configure spring.jpa.open-in-view to disable this warning
```

This [article](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-open-session-in-view) covers some additional information about the OSIV
pattern.

For new development, disable this ASAP:

```yaml
spring:
  jpa:
    open-in-view: false
```
