# 00.0 - Overview

In these labs, you will learn how to use [YugabyteDB](https://www.yugabyte.com/) with
[Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) and [Testcontainers](https://www.testcontainers.org/) to create
reusable tests for your applications.

Testcontainers is a library that makes it easy to create and manage Docker containers from within most popular testing
harnesses. It provides an rich API that can orchestrate and configure Docker containers.

These labs also use [Flyway](https://flywaydb.org/) to manage the schema and data. Flyway is a database migration tool
that provides version control for database schema and data. It integrates well with Spring Boot and Testcontainers.
