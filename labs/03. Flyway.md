# 03.0 - Using Flyway

Flyway is a popular database migration tool that simplifies the process of managing changes to your database schema and
data. In a Spring Boot application, Flyway can be easily integrated to manage the database migrations automatically as
part of the application startup process.

When using Flyway with Spring Boot, you can define the migration scripts in a specified directory, and Flyway will
automatically execute them in the order specified. You can also use placeholders to configure the connection properties,
such as the database name, username, and password. Flyway also supports undoing the migrations, so you can easily roll
back to a previous version of the schema.

# 03.1 - Add a Flyway Migration

Add a file name `V1_0_0__init.sql` to the `src/main/resources/db/migration` folder.  Flyway follows a very specific
versioning pattern and will apply DDL/DML changes in that order.

To that file add:

```postgresql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp" SCHEMA public;

CREATE TABLE account
(
    id             UUID PRIMARY KEY      DEFAULT public.uuid_generate_v4(),
    email          VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    user_name      VARCHAR(30)  NOT NULL,
    is_active      BOOLEAN      NOT NULL DEFAULT TRUE,
    created_at     TIMESTAMPTZ  NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
    last_access_at TIMESTAMPTZ  NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);
```

We'll use this as our first database table.

If we start the application now we will observe in the Flyway migration in the logs.  Flyway will create and manage its
own migration table as well as whatever is provided in the migration folder.

The Flyway table `flyway_schema_history` keeps track of the migrations it has already applied, so it won't rerun them
again.

# 03.2 - Add a Flyway Migration for Data

Next create a migration file for the data called `V1_0_1__init_test_data.sql`.  However, this is just testing data, we
don't actually want to include this is the production deploy.  To solve that, we can create a parallel folder for
testing data in `src/main/resources/db/testing`:

```postgresql
insert into account (id, email, user_name, is_active, created_at, last_access_at) values ('b6a823e1-bc70-4a5f-b1e3-a16a0b0abe4b', 'fmanwaring0@vimeo.com', 'gserrels0', false, '5/19/2022', '3/5/2023');
insert into account (id, email, user_name, is_active, created_at, last_access_at) values ('90ed7860-bd95-40e7-804e-03936db01af2', 'sheakins1@blinklist.com', 'sgally1', false, '4/29/2023', '5/15/2023');
insert into account (id, email, user_name, is_active, created_at, last_access_at) values ('4b877ef0-37c1-46fe-85e4-157650c8a1a3', 'gvasilyevski2@answers.com', 'cmackney2', false, '9/22/2022', '5/13/2023');
insert into account (id, email, user_name, is_active, created_at, last_access_at) values ('4f6d8e72-63c7-441f-babc-edf9557383d0', 'bsteger3@ibm.com', 'csmeaton3', true, '2/4/2023', '2/9/2023');
insert into account (id, email, user_name, is_active, created_at, last_access_at) values ('f2aa9f48-3ba3-4f4a-9085-53e67187adf1', 'hbaggett4@dyndns.org', 'cfaudrie4', true, '11/22/2022', '5/3/2023');
insert into account (id, email, user_name, is_active, created_at, last_access_at) values ('16160adc-e23a-4051-a096-4c0a7d654a2c', 'tsmalman5@ft.com', 'mbassett5', false, '3/27/2023', '5/15/2023');
insert into account (id, email, user_name, is_active, created_at, last_access_at) values ('6ba1bf3d-c45b-47c3-8ec1-c585b1a23005', 'dbullerwell6@ycombinator.com', 'bbesset6', false, '8/25/2022', '4/24/2023');
insert into account (id, email, user_name, is_active, created_at, last_access_at) values ('435f9e9f-9136-4f13-becd-df6e350f1190', 'lfarenden7@jugem.jp', 'tparish7', true, '8/9/2022', '1/15/2023');
insert into account (id, email, user_name, is_active, created_at, last_access_at) values ('d0edfcf9-1afd-4fe0-8846-ee0b0fe82dd5', 'jhavile8@amazon.com', 'enorthcott8', false, '8/25/2022', '2/4/2023');
insert into account (id, email, user_name, is_active, created_at, last_access_at) values ('05b80f10-08f9-40be-9925-2a4101e69fa4', 'ccollyns9@dyndns.org', 'bburriss9', true, '12/8/2022', '4/14/2023');
```

Data generated from [Mockaroo](https://mockaroo.com/).

Because we put the file outside the default migration folder, it will not automatically be picked up by Flyway.

We don't want this data to be accidentally applied when deployed, so we can insulate this configuration by using a local
development profile in Spring.  To do that, create a new configuration file called `application-local.yml` in
`src/main/resources`.

In this file define a Flyway override config:

```yaml
spring:
  flyway:
    locations: classpath:db/migration,classpath:db/testing
```

If we run the application with the "local" profile, then Flyway will see any additional migrations and aggregate them
across the two folders.

NOTE: the migration version convention is still in play, so it is important to keep the data migrations identified in a
way that won't collide with actual migrations.  In this example, I'll only use the micro version for test data.

HINT: In IntelliJ it is easy to configure the run profile's "Active Profile" to `local`.

# 03.3 - BONUS: Write a Migration Test

Let's write a JUnit test for the Flyway migration (hint, Flyway can help out with that).

Add a new dependency got the `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
    testImplementation 'org.flywaydb.flyway-test-extensions:flyway-spring-test:9.5.0'
```

This [library](https://github.com/flyway/flyway-test-extensions/) provides helper classes to manipulate the Flyway
lifecycle during testing.

Additionally, create a test specific Spring profile configuration.  This one we don't ever want packaged with the final
bundle, so we'll put it in `src/test/resources` (create this folder if you have to) as `application-test.yml`

```yaml
spring:
  flyway:
    clean-disabled: false
  jpa:
    hibernate:
      ddl-auto: validate
  test:
    database:
      replace: none
```

In the testing profile, we want the ability to let Flyway "clean" the database.  Spring Boot rightly disables this by
default, so it needs to be manually enabled.  Additionally, it's not a bad idea to validate the schema during testing
with Hibernate.  Finally, be specific about disabling Spring's support for embedded databases - we'll come back to this
later with the Testcontainer labs.

Create a test class in `src/test/com/yugabyte/labs/ysql/tc` called `FlywayMigrationTests.java`:

```java
package com.yugabyte.labs.ysql.tc;

import org.flywaydb.test.FlywayTestExecutionListener;
import org.flywaydb.test.annotation.FlywayTest;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

import java.util.zip.CRC32;

import static org.hamcrest.CoreMatchers.is;
import static org.hamcrest.MatcherAssert.assertThat;

@SpringBootTest
@ActiveProfiles({"test"})
@TestExecutionListeners({DependencyInjectionTestExecutionListener.class, FlywayTestExecutionListener.class})
public class FlywayMigrationTests {

    @Autowired
    private JdbcTemplate template;

    @Autowired
    private ResourcePatternResolver resourcePatternResolver;

    /**

     * </ul>
     */
    @Test
    @FlywayTest(locationsForMigrate = {"/db/testing"})
    void runMigration_SelectCountFromFlywaySchemaHistory() throws Exception {

        // count the number of successful migrations in the flyway_schema_history table
        // this should match the number of migration files in db/migration plus db/testing (as included above)
        var migrationCount = template.queryForObject("select count(*) from flyway_schema_history where success = true", Integer.class);
        assertThat(migrationCount, is(2));

        // for each matching migration file, confirm that it matches the flyway_schema_history checksum
        Arrays.stream(resourcePatternResolver.getResources("classpath*:db/**/V*.sql"))
                .forEach(r -> {
                    var checksum = template.queryForObject("select checksum from flyway_schema_history where script = ?", Integer.class, r.getFilename());
                    assertThat(String.format("Flyway checksum did not match for '%s'", r.getFilename()),
                            checksum, is(calculateFlywayChecksum(r)));
                });
    }

    /*
     * Emulated Flyway checksum calculator (as we did not want to depend on Flyway internal classes).
     */
    private int calculateFlywayChecksum(Resource resource) {
        var crc32 = new CRC32();
        try (var reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(resource.getInputStream()), 4096)) {
            reader.lines()
                    .map(l -> l.replaceFirst("^\uFEFF", "")) // remove BOM
                    .map(l -> l.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8))
                    .forEach(crc32::update);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            throw new RuntimeException("Unable to calculate checksum of " + resource.getFilename(), e);
        }
        return (int) crc32.getValue();
    }
}
```

Let's review this code since there are a few new concepts:

```java
@SpringBootTest
@ActiveProfiles({"test"})
@TestExecutionListeners({DependencyInjectionTestExecutionListener.class, FlywayTestExecutionListener.class})
```

* `@SpringBootTest` causes a full instance of the web container to launch, this is the "heaviest" of tests you can
write with Spring.

* `@ActiveProfiles` is used to activate the new `test` profile configuration we just created.

* The _ExecutionListeners_ are activated to enable `@Autowire` for the `JDBCTemplate` and the Flyway extensions.

* `@FlywayTest` provides extensions that can control what migration folders are used and what lifecycle events to
trigger.  This can be useful for certain test suites.

The actual tests are fairly simple and meant to be a representation of the things you might want to validate after a
migration - feel free to expand upon these in your own tests.

```
WARNING!!! Flyway will "clean" the existing database with this configuration.  This means it will effectively drop
existing tables and data.  This may not always be desirable if you are running your own standalone instance for local
testing.  Future labs will help resolve this, but for now don't run the test unless you're okay with having the database
cleaned out from under you.
```

### Summary

Now we have a table and data that is going to be created and managed by Flyway going forward.  So in theory, we are
ready to start developing code.
